This is a C++ Project which will read a .txt file for a list of sold items, it will calculate the frequencies using maps and can also sort the data with a histogram. It has a fully functioning menu and exit function so the program can exit gracefully. The program will also automatically create a .dat backup file of the sold items and frequencies upon start up.
